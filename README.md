It would be greate to do next things in the app:
* create and compile special song markdown
* compiler from special songs markdown to the docs
* compile to html

##smd format

* great and simple songs md language
* can be created with fancy visual interface
* can be written directly with any text editor
* parse holychords songs to smd
  

## what types of data it has?

[lyrics]
[song_block]
[song_block_name]
[chord]

[hint]
[dynamic_range]

## how can I mark each data-type?
(smd should be readable natively)

[lyrics] - everything not marked
[song_block] - when it is empty line between anything
[song_block_name] - at the beginning of song_block and started with #
[chord] - something in brakets and looks like chord
